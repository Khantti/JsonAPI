=> XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
eXtensible = Extend our notation
Markup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own document

XML is not all the same HTML. But both are markup language
XML is used to describe the data. HTML is used to display the data
XML must define custom rules(tags). HTML has pre-defined rules(tags)

HTML document = Display Data (HTML was designed to display data and focus how data look)
