= Same origin policy

URL                                              Outcome                        Reason
http://dltbank.com/transfer/create.html          Same origin
http://dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html    Same origin                    only path different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html Different origin               Different Protocol
http://tha.dltbank.com:81/transfer/create.html   Different origin               Different Port (http:// is port 80 by default)
http://news.dltbank.com:81/article.html          Different origin               different host

Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for geniune use cases
CORS is an extension of the same origin policy
you need CORS when u need to pull data from external API that are public or authorized or (authorized third-party access)
